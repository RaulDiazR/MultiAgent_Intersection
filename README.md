# MultiAgent-Intersection

## Description

MultiAgent-Intersection is a simulation project that creates a virtual city with various types of intersections, populated by cars that adhere to the rules of each intersection, including traffic lights and road signs. This project serves as a valuable educational tool for understanding multi-agent systems.

## Installation

## Installation

To run MultiAgent-Intersection, you need to have Python installed on your system. Additionally, you'll need the following Python libraries:

- numpy
- mesa
- flask
- json
- uuid
- pygame
- PyOpenGL
- math
- requests

You can install Python from the [official website](https://www.python.org/downloads) and install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy mesa flask json uuid pygame PyOpenGL math requests
```
## Usage

To execute the project, follow these steps:

2. Run the `backend.py` file in a single terminal. This process must run in the background for the program to function correctly. Use the following command to execute the Python code:

```bash
python backend.py
```

Note that the `backend.py` file is located inside the 'backend' folder, and all the files in this folder handle the logical section of the program.

3. After executing `backend.py`, open a new terminal. In this terminal, run the `simulation.py` file. The `simulation.py` file is located in the main directory of the project, along with all the components of the graphical section of the program. Use the following command to execute the Python code:

```bash
python simulation.py
```

Congratulations! By following the steps outlined above, the program should now run without any issues. Please be aware that the program's execution speed may be slow on computers with limited resources.
