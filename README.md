# MultiAgent-Intersection

## Description

MultiAgent-Intersection is a simulation project that creates a virtual city with various types of intersections, populated by cars that adhere to the rules of each intersection, including traffic lights and road signs. This project serves as a valuable educational tool for understanding multi-agent systems.

## Installation

To run MultiAgent-Intersection, you need to have Python installed on your system. Additionally, you'll need the following Python libraries:

- numpy
- mesa
- OpenGL

You can install Python from the [official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy mesa PyOpenGL
```

## Usage
